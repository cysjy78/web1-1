  The World Wide Web, commonly known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identifie<br>
  d by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible via the<br>
  Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users via a software application called a web browser.<br>
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near<br>
 Geneva, Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 <br>
 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age<br>
  and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6]<br>
Web resources may be any type of downloadable media, but web pages are hypertext media which have been formatted in Hypertext Markup<br>
anguage (HTML).[7] Such formatting allows for embedded hyperlinks which contain URLs and permit users to easily navigate to other web<br>
 resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's<br>
  web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.
